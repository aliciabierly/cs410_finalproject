# CS 410 (Topological Data Analysis) Final Project
Collaborators: Alicia Bierly, Madeline Kloberdanz, and Shannon Raloff

In this study, we apply persistent homology to compare topological features of three hemoglobin forms, oxygenated, deoxygenated, and sickle-cell hemoglobin, using atomic coordinate data from Protein Data Bank (.pdb) files. We construct Vietoris–Rips complexes and generate persistence diagrams and barcodes to identify structural differences, quantified through bottleneck distances and statistical testing. Results reveal distinguishable topological signatures between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, with significant variation in dimension-1 features between sickle-cell and wild-type hemoglobin. These findings suggest that persistent homology can capture meaningful geometric perturbations due to oxygen binding and pathogenic mutation.
