Understanding the structural variations of hemoglobin is essential for interpreting its function and dysfunction, especially in the context of diseases such as sickle cell anemia. While traditional structural biology techniques have elucidated many aspects of hemoglobin's conformations, recent advances in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offer new tools for quantifying subtle changes in protein structure. In this study, we apply persistent homology to compare topological features of three hemoglobin forms, oxygenated, deoxygenated, and sickle-cell hemoglobin, using atomic coordinate data from Protein Data Bank (.pdb) files. We construct Vietorisâ€“Rips complexes and generate persistence diagrams and barcodes to identify structural differences, quantified through bottleneck distances and statistical testing. Results reveal distinguishable topological signatures between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, with significant variation in dimension-1 features between sickle-cell and wild-type hemoglobin. These findings suggest that persistent homology can capture meaningful geometric perturbations due to oxygen binding and pathogenic mutation. Our study highlights TDA as a promising computational framework for protein structure analysis, with potential applications in identifying functionally important regions, guiding drug development, and complementing precision medicine approaches.
